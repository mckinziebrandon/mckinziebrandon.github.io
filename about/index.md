## Is This Thing On

Hi, I am trying to make a website. Please visit the "Notes", "Project", or "Posts" section.

![Doggoo](http://i.imgur.com/jkda3Kj.png){: .image-right}

It actually has stuff. Enjoy your visit and browse around while me and construction dog get back to work. 

Also, enjoy <a href="http://nuclear.ucdavis.edu/~bmckinzie/">this silly website I made</a> years ago when I got my start in
physics research at UC Davis. Shoutout to Professor Manuel Calderon for being one of the greatest mentors I've been lucky enough
to have.

TODO: Write about myself. Thank all the other people that deserve being thanked.
