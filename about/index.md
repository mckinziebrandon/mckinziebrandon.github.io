# Who Am I?

That's a great question. For the purposes of this site, I'll keep this pragmatic. I am . . . 

![Existential Robot](http://i.imgur.com/ekNkDTM.jpg "Existential Robot"){: .image-right}

* An undergraduate senior at UC Berkeley, majoring in Physics and minoring in Computer Science. Although, for all intents and purposes, I've primarily been a CS student for about the past year.
* A researcher. I've devoted a substantial portion of the past four years working as a student researcher at various institutions.
Most of my research background has been in particle physics. More recently, I've worked in CS-related research such as in virtual
reality (MIT) and now deep learning (UC Berkeley). 


# What You'll Find on This Site

Below are links to the different sections of this site and brief summaries of the corresponding content.

* [Research]({{site.url}}/research): Brief descriptions of some select research projects of mine. 
* [Notes]({{site.url}}/notes): Descriptions and Links to PDFs of my course notes, all written in LaTeX. 
* [Posts]({{site.url}}/posts): A mix of miscellaneous blog posts and mini-projects.


# Research Papers

I plan on moving this to the "research" section later, but for now I just want to get these up here. 

TODO: Move research papers out of about section. Upload more of them.

# Presentations

Similarly, here are links to various presentations (posters/slides/etc.) I've made on my research.
