# About Me

I'm currently a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer at Forge.AI. I have the privilege of splitting my time between research and engineering, as Forge implements the state-of-the-art at scale. Accordingly, I spend my days implementing and my nights researching in order to stay up-to-date with the rapid advances taking place in the NLP research community. I'm particularly interested in recent developments in neuroscience, and using them as inspiration for my research in NLP.

For the engineering side of things, I develop my models using TensorFlow and custom extensions of the TensorFlow source code. When a model is ready, it is exported to a binary protobuf format and served in a custom C++ environment built with Bazel. I'm currently working on converting TensorFlow Serving from being gRPC-based to a traditional REST API, and I plan on posting the process so others may be able to do so easily, too.

While an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, I devoted the majority of my time to research, working for institutions such as MIT, UC Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory. My research background is primarily in computational particle physics and, in particular, analyzing large datasets from collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In the past few years, my interests have shifted to research in deep learning and natural language processing. In a sentence, my work has involved automatic architecture generation for deep neural networks, sequence-to-sequence models for conversational dialogue, and unsupervised methods for text processing.

# What You'll Find on This Site

Below are links to the different sections of this site and brief summaries of the corresponding content.

* [Research]({{site.url}}/research): Brief descriptions of some select research projects of mine. 
* [Notes]({{site.url}}/notes): Descriptions and Links to PDFs of my course notes, all written in LaTeX. 
* [Posts]({{site.url}}/posts): A mix of miscellaneous blog posts and mini-projects. Currently extremely outdated, hoping to post some new information soon!


# Research Papers

I plan on moving this to the "research" section later, but for now I just want to get these up here. 

TODO: Move research papers out of about section. Upload more of them.
