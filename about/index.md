## Is This Thing On

Hi, I am trying to make a website. Please visit the "Notes", "Project", or "Posts" section.

It actually has stuff. Enjoy your visit and browse around while me and construction dog get back to work. 

Also, enjoy <a href="http://nuclear.ucdavis.edu/~bmckinzie/">this silly webiste I made</a> years ago when I got my start in
physics research at UC Davis. Shoutout to Professor Manuel Calderon for being one of the greatest mentors I've been lucky enough
to have.

TODO: Write about myself. Thank all the other people that deserve being thanked.

## On the subject of people that should be thanked . . . 

Yesterday, November 8th, 2016, was a sad day indeed for the United States. Although much need be said here, I just want to thank
the awesome guy below, __President Barack Obama__.
