![Existential Robot](http://i.imgur.com/ekNkDTM.jpg "Existential Robot"){: .image-right}

* An undergraduate senior at UC Berkeley, majoring in Physics and minoring in Computer Science. Although, for all intents and purposes, I've primarily been a CS student for about the past year.
* A researcher. I've devoted substantial portion of the past four years working as a student researcher at various institutions.
Most of my research background has been in particle physics. More recently, I've worked in CS-related research such as in virtual
reality (MIT) and now deep learning (UC Berkeley).
