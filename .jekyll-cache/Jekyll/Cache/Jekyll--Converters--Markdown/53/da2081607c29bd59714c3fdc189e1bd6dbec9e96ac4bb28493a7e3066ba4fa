<p>Have you ever dreamed of learning a new skill, but you were afraid of injury or exerting too much effort? Thatâ€™s how I felt when I used to dream about
juggling. Yes, tossing any imaginable assortment of objects into the air and be the commander of their trajectory. But alas, all
my years studying physics had ingrained in me a fear of accelerating objects and their devastating effects. I was afraid.</p>

<p>A hot topic in the current VR research community is creating virtual spaces that allow one to freely experiment and learn new
skills. The options are without bound. My fear of large quantities of small objects falling from the sky prevented me from
exploring the world of juggling. Yet, as seen in the video below, virtual reality allowed me to learn in a safe virtual space.</p>

<p>Here is whatâ€™s going on:</p>

<p><strong>Hardware/Software Overview</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This project was written in the Unity3D game engine.</li>
  <li>The programs responsible for translating my movements were written in the C# programming language. The primary libraries used were Unityâ€™s framework (of course) and the SteamVR Unity pluginâ€™s library for interfacing with the HTC Vive.</li>
  <li>The thing blocking my eyes is the <strong>HTC Vive</strong>, which allows me to enter virtual worlds after I create them.</li>
  <li>Attached to my arms are a total of four <strong>Inertial Measurement Units (IMU).</strong> Their job is to provide spatial orientation information. Each arm has two IMUâ€™s and an <strong>Arduino</strong>.</li>
  <li>Each hand has <strong>bend sensors</strong> on the fingers. (well, only one finger per hand in this video. Thatâ€™s what I get for only taking one video before the project was finished)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Watch the Laptop Screen</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Even with the professional quality video, it may be hard to see what is going on. As far as Iâ€™m aware (in the video), I am a robot in a strange world of floating red balls. Furthermore, the red balls become green when a grab them with my new virtual
  hands. Iâ€™m able to pick them up and toss them around <strong>without needing to hold a controller</strong>. I can see my virtual body, my
  virtual arms, and my virtual hands move exactly as I do. I could not tell you the number of times I hit the walls of that
  office while juggling in my virtual world (enough).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus Video</strong>:</p>

<p>Below is a higher-quality demo of the project given by Andres Calvo, my advisor on the project and Masterâ€™s student at the Media Lab. Thanks Andres!</p>
