# Explore My LaTeX Obsession

Here you'll find my notes for the current (Fall 2016) semester. I have a passion for "making things look nice". Many of the little customizations you'll find in my notes are from LaTeX packages I've written. Each
package is usually born in the hour-long google session of *why can't I make it look like [insert trivial change here]*.
These notes would not be possible without my inability to ignore a formatting issue. For even more fun, notice how the formatting
in each set of notes improves as you progress through the chapters.

## [(In Progress) Deep Learning Notes]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/CondensedSummaries.pdf)

Since graduating, I've been going through various books/MOOCs on deep learning, compiling notes along the way. The main sources are 

* Deep Learning by Goodfellow, et al.
* Various ML/DL blogs, notably Colah's blog and WildML.
* Miscellaneous papers from groups like DeepMind.
