# Explore My LaTeX Obsession

Here you'll find my notes for various courses and textbooks I've read in my spare time. I have a passion for "making things look nice". Many of the little customizations you'll find in my notes are from LaTeX packages I've written. Each
package is usually born in the hour-long google session of *why can't I make it look like [insert trivial change here]*.
These notes would not be possible without my inability to ignore a formatting issue. 

## [(In Progress) Deep Learning Notes]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/CondensedSummaries.pdf)

Since graduating, I've been working through various textbooks/papers, compiling notes along the way. Originally this was just a single document, but it became too large to compile in TextStudio! Now it is comprised of the following sub-documents:

* [Deep Learning by Goodfellow, et al.]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/DeepLearningBook.pdf)
* [Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky and Martin]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/MiscStanford.pdf)
* [Other Textbooks]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/Textbooks.pdf)
    * Probabilistic Graphical Models by Koller and Friedman.
    * Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by Mackay.
    * Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy. 
    * Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al.
* [Papers]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/PapersAndTutorials.pdf): A subset of my favorite papers that I frequently reference for my work.
* [Misc concepts/clarifications]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/BlogsAndAppendix.pdf) on a variety of ML topics. 

The full single document, before breaking up into the chunks above, can be reached by clicking the button below.

## Stanford Courses
