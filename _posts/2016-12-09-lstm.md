excerpt: "Generating Reddit Comments with numpy implementations of RNNs and LSTMs, as well as a TFLearn implementation for fun."
tags: [numpy, tflearn, python]

Here we work through implementations of a "vanilla" (as basic as it gets) __Recurrent Neural Network__ and a __Long Short Term Memory network__ for generating reddit comments. As a bonus, at the end we will also implement a more sophisticated network using TFlearn to see the real power of such networks. 

### Sneak Peek: Example Results for Each Implementation

__VanillaRNN__:

* Many should still especially as me in n't nothing as the fight combat are favorite of your lot of with great towards using the time away for the # in most ( now 
* The blood is people idea they be make a 3 than law to be like were not who n't have them , i 've like like in my population you have has as they have an tree '' is a wants to eating 3a in the decent healthy does n't internet about excited date as it.
* It should know arguing really pounds and much.
* If you can both used as the fact [expletive] is better or kind and quickly with the [expletive] maybe i did already know.

__LSTM__:

* People cash everything and christian the to dust or the glorious.
* Education time is is empty ps4.
* Downvote problems asking marriage defender or to into about 'm you more your go way do abilities.
* Do riot vocal lol.
* Generally saying was interesting on wait.

__TFLearn Implementation__:

* Provide some flexibity and a good. 
* It sounds the sure and stread and of the fart to a some of the part. 
* In games journalism that do the press and the lan meaning.

## Data Preprocessing 


```python

import csv as csv
import itertools
import nltk

vocabulary_size = 4000
unknown_token = "UNKNOWN_TOKEN"
sentence_start_token = "SENTENCE_START"
sentence_end_token = "SENTENCE_END"
 
# Read the data and append SENTENCE_START and SENTENCE_END tokens
print( "Reading CSV file...")
with open('python/med_reddit.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, skipinitialspace=True)
    reader.__next__()
    # Split full comments into sentences
    sentences = itertools.chain(*[nltk.sent_tokenize(x[0].lower()) for x in reader])
    # Append SENTENCE_START and SENTENCE_END
    sentences = ["%s %s %s" % (sentence_start_token, x, sentence_end_token) for x in sentences]
print( "Parsed %d sentences." % (len(sentences)))
     
# Tokenize the sentences into words
tokenized_sentences = [nltk.word_tokenize(sent) for sent in sentences]
 
# Count the word frequencies
word_freq = nltk.FreqDist(itertools.chain(*tokenized_sentences))
print("Found %d unique words tokens." % len(word_freq.items()))
 
# Get the most common words and build index_to_word and word_to_index vectors
vocab = word_freq.most_common(vocabulary_size-1)
index_to_word = [x[0] for x in vocab]
index_to_word.append(unknown_token)
word_to_index = dict([(w,i) for i,w in enumerate(index_to_word)])
 
print( "Using vocabulary size %d." % vocabulary_size)
print( "Least frequent word in vocab: '%s', which appeared %d times." % (vocab[-1][0], vocab[-1][1]))
 
# Replace all words not in our vocabulary with the unknown token
for i, sent in enumerate(tokenized_sentences):
    tokenized_sentences[i] = [w if w in word_to_index else unknown_token for w in sent]
 
print("\nExample sentence: '%s'" % sentences[0])
print( "\nExample sentence after Pre-processing: '%s'" % tokenized_sentences[0])
 
# Create the training data
X_train = np.asarray([[word_to_index[w] for w in sent[:-1]] for sent in tokenized_sentences])
y_train = np.asarray([[word_to_index[w] for w in sent[1:]] for sent in tokenized_sentences])
print(type(tokenized_sentences))
```

    Reading CSV file...
    Parsed 23335 sentences.
    Found 31209 unique words tokens.
    Using vocabulary size 4000.
    Least frequent word in vocab: 'knee', which appeared 8 times.
    
    Example sentence: 'SENTENCE_START i joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than i'm used to. SENTENCE_END'
    
    Example sentence after Pre-processing: '['SENTENCE_START', 'i', 'joined', 'a', 'new', 'league', 'this', 'year', 'and', 'they', 'have', 'different', 'UNKNOWN_TOKEN', 'rules', 'than', 'i', "'m", 'used', 'to', '.', 'SENTENCE_END']'

* Inputs: \\(x_t\\), the input at time step \\(t\\).
* Hidden: $s_t$ is the "memory" of the network. $$s_t = f(U x_t + W s_{t - 1})$$

* Output: $o_t$ is calculated solely based on memory at time t, given by $s_t$, e.g.
    $$ o_t = \mathrm{softmax}(V s_t) $$


### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

Code is based on the ideas from [this tutorial](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).

#### Here I go taking derivatives again

I'm denoting inputs, hidden, and outputs at time t, respectively, as $x_t^{(0)}$, $x_t^{(1)}$,$x_t^{(2)}$, all of which are vectors. TODO: Write more explanations here/finish.

Note the timesteps during training below. In just a matter of minutes, the network is able to output somewhat reasonable looking results. If we were to run this on [not my laptop], we'd expect rather convincing comments to be generated.


```python
ind = np.random.randint(0, X_train.shape[0], size=1000)
losses = train_with_sgd(model, X_train[ind], y_train[ind], nepoch=10, evaluate_loss_after=1)
```


```python
generate(model, n_sentences=10, min_length=10)

# Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMS)

Now reading through [this overview](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

For comparison, here is how this tutorial illustrate the vanilla RNN:
<img src="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/RNN-unrolled.png" width="350"/>

__Purpose__: Better deal with the problem of long-term dependencies, e.g. "I grew up in France... I speak fluent _French_" could be difficult for a vanilla RNN, depending on how far the gap between "France" and trying to predict the word "French". LSTMs solve this problem.

<img src="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM3-chain.png" width="550"/>
<img src="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/LSTM2-notation.png"  width="400"/>

__Core Idea__: The cell state, which is the horizontal line running through the top of the diagram.
* _Gates_, the areas composed of a $\sigma$ layer and pointwise multiplication (x) operation, are a way to optionally let information through [to the cell state]. The output of the sigmoid, between 0 and 1, tells how much info to let through to the cell.

__Three Main Gates__:
1. The "forget gate" layer. Determines which information to throw away from the cell state. 
2. The "input gate" layer, comprised of the second $\sigma$ and tanh, Determines what new info to store in the cell state. 
3. The output gate. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we're going to output. Then, we put the cell state through tanh (to push the values to be between -1 and 1) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to. 


__Conceptual Explanation of Gates__:

1. __Cell State__: Tells you which hidden states were important from past step and which are important from current step. 
2. __Middle Gates__: So the sigmoid allows us to tune which hidden values are most important for this time step, and the tanh our good ol' pal from the original RNN. 
3. __Rightmost Gates__: sigmoid for deciding the values to use from the cell state, and we send the cell state back through tanh to make its values in [-1, 1].
