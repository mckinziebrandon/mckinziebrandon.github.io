# The Best Way to Learn is to Teach

At least, I hope so. Here I'll go over how to build a simple deep neural network (DNN) using the TensorFlow libraries (Python). I'll be focusing more on conceptual stuff.

## Architecture

I *was* going to show a snippet of code below of some confusing jekyll-infused html, but apparently jekyll reads the snippet and
actually tries executing it. Sorry to let you, my imaginary reader, down. Hopefully this code snippet below that came with the
theme will cheer you up. <br/>


Wait, I need to type just a little more text to provide room for the code snippet. Of course, I could customize the appropriate
CSS file to resize the image, or I could even go brute force and just write the html img element in the poor markdown file. But we
all know that is not okay. Thus, I type. 

{% highlight html %}
<a href="#" class="btn btn-success">Success Button</a>
{% endhighlight %}
